# TCP Toolkit by Nullified
Hello! You landed on this site because you entered the right address to my project site!<br>
TCP Toolkit is an actual toolkit built for testing communication between a client and server. Beside of that, I also included things like:
+ A computer lagger (idk what's the use of this)
+ TCP spammer
